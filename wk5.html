      Heya, this week I started learning the basics of JavaScript. So far it's been fairly simple to understand as its somewhat similar to languages I have already learnt
      (In particular Python lol) <br>
      <br>
      Im gonna write a bit so this will be significantly longer than the others lol.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are of course differences in both languages  <br>
      Objects seems to act like dictionaries in Python, they both have a key value pair function. <br>
      However the main difference is that the "Keys" in objects are reffered as properties (cuz they are "objects") <br>
      Anyways, in order to refer to objects, you can just type the object name and the property you are refering to after a dot. For example:
      <hr>
      <p id="code">
      <span id= "tag"> var </span> objectThing = <span id="ids"> { </span> <br>
        color : <span id="ids"> "blue"</span> <br>
        number : <span id="number"> 2</span> <br>
        Value : <span id="ids"> true</span> <br>
        <span id="ids"> } </span>
        <br>
        objectThing.color <br>
        objectThing.Value = <span id="ids"> false</span> <br>
        objectThing.string = <span id="ids"> "Words"</span> <br>
        <br>
        objectThing
      </p>
      <hr>
      So what this will print is
      <hr>
      <p id="code">
        <span id="log"> 'blue'</span> <br>
        <span id="ids"> false</span> <br>
        <span id="log"> 'Words'</span> <br>
        { color: <span id="log"> 'blue'</span>, number: <span id="number"> 2</span>, Value: <span id="ids"> false</span>, string:<span id="log"> 'Words'</span>}
      </p>
      <hr>
      As you can see its very straightforward and simple compared to python where you have to type fromkeys() or whatever
    </p> 
    <p>
      There are some other features that I like though, for example: <br>
      Theres two types of comparison operators, them being == and === <br>
      The difference between them is that === is more strict, for example: <br>
      <hr>
      <p id="code">
      <span id= "tag"> var </span> one = <span id="ids"> "1"  </span> <br>
      one <span id = "operator"> == </span> <span id="number"> 1 </span> <br>
      one <span id = "operator"> === </span> <span id="number"> 1 </span> <br>
      </p> 
      <hr>
      The 1st comparison line (==) will print out a <span id="ids"> true </span> value <br>
      while the 2nd comparison line (===) will print out a <span id="ids"> false </span> value <br>
      Thats because the variable one is a string value of "1" <br>
      Since === is more strict, "1" is not the same as 1 <br>    
      So since == is less strict, it treats "1" and 1 as the same <br>
      <br>
      Some functions are also simplified, for example if you want to check the type of variable a variable is, you use <span id="tag">typeof</span> <br>
      Very straightforward which I like so. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are of course some things I dislike about JavaScript. <br>
      One such is that "and" operators and "or" operators are not words but are <span id="tag"> && </span> and <span id="tag"> || </span> respectively <br>
      It will be pretty weird to type them out, especially <span id="tag"> || </span> but I think I'll get used to it at some point <br>
      Well, at least if operators are still if
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing to note is that it seems to follow C language syntax when it comes to conditionals and functions where you need to type {} after. <br>  
      Though it seems possible to type one liners in if else statements. (Usually only applicable if there is one if else statement) <br>
      <br>
      There is also other methods apart from if and else, one of them are called switch case. They act as a bunch of if else statements but they require a <span id="tag"> break </span> statement
      since each case does not have a {}. <br>
      Theres also something called <span id="tag"> default </span> that really is just the last "else" in a multiple if else block. <br>
      Overall this is an interesting method for if else and it has other applications such as cascading code by omitting the <span id="tag"> break </span> <br>
      <br>
      But that's not all, there is another method for one liner if else statement which uses <span id="tag">?</span> and <span id="tag">:</span> <br>
      If its not obvious the <span id="tag">? </span> refers to "if" and <span id="tag">:</span> refers to "else". <br>
      They look kinda weird to read but its shorter that if else. I don't think I will be using this method often though.
    </p>
    Anyways, I don't really wanna put the screenshots on this page (for the quizzes) so you can refer to them <a href= "images.html" title = "Images"> here</a> lol
