    Heya, this week I learnt more about flex formatting, such as fitting different objects based of the screen size, making it responsize to mobile phones.

    I also switched to using Visual Studio Code for programming html and css apart from using it for C#. Anyways not much else.
    Next week I'll be learning JavaScript so that will be way more interesting.
